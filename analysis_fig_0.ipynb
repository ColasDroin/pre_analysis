For exact retiming, the first fade frame is 0.06 on the timer. If using Usamune, the first frame the Stage RTA timer says START is 0.03. Timing ends on the first frame of stardust upon grabbing the final star.<br/> Allowed Codes<br/>If using the latest Usamune (latest version: v1.92 as of this writing), it is strongly recommended to use the Stage RTA preset (MENU > MISC > PRESET > STGRTA). If you choose to use your own settings or only have a Gameshark, the following codes are allowed:<br/>- Star Select (RESET > LBUTTON/LxR > SSLECT)<br/>- Manual Timer + Star-Grab/X-Cam Timer (TIMER > STOP/DISPLAY > GRAB/XCAM)<br/>- Real Time Timer (TIMER > REALTMR)<br/>- Make Timer Display Centiseconds (only relevant to Gameshark)<br/>- Lag Frame Counter (HUD > LIFE > LAG or HUD > STAR > LAG)<br/>- Display Lag Frame Counter as Life Count (only relevant to Gameshark)<br/>- Automatically Reset Timer at Star Select (only relevant to Gameshark)<br/>- Automatically Reset Counter at Star Select (only relevant to Gameshark)<br/>- Modifying the Timer Coordinates (TIMER > TMRPOSI > LEFT)<br/>- Setting the starting mission (RESET > DEFMISS)<br/>- Stars always yellow (MISC > *COLOR > YELLOW)<br/> Banned Codes/Settings<br/>The following settings/codes are banned and using them will result in your run being rejected.
